# OList Retail Dataset#

OList is an e-commerce company that has faced some losses recently and they want to manage their inventory very well so as to reduce any unnecessary costs that they might be bearing.

In this assignment, we need to manage the inventory cost of this e-commerce company. We need to identify top products that contribute to the revenue and also use market basket analysis to analyse the purchase behaviour of individual customers to estimate with relative certainty, what items are more likely to be purchased individually or in combination with some other products.
